# het_agent_models

Hello! 

This is my personal repository where I store codes for solving heterogeneous agent models using Julia.

The codes are mostly based on the [NBER's Heterogeneous-Agent Macro Workshop](https://www.nber.org/conferences/heterogeneous-agent-macro-workshop-spring-2022), originally written in Python.

The repository includes solving the following models
- Ayagari (1995)
- Hopenhayn (1992)
- Krusell-Smith
